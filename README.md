# Survival Analysis with Random Forests and Repeated Cross-Validation

## Overview

This repository contains R scripts designed for performing advanced survival analysis using Random Forest Survival (RFS) models considering the competing risk. The workflow incorporates repeated 5-fold cross-validation to ensure robust model evaluation. Key evaluation metrics such as time-dependent Area Under the Curve (AUC), Brier Score, Integrated Brier Score (IBS), and Concordance Index (C-index) are computed. Additionally, the repository includes comprehensive visualization tools for assessing model performance and calibration.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Preparation**: Efficiently loads and preprocesses survival data from Excel files.
- **Repeated Cross-Validation**: Implements a 5Ã—5 cross-validation strategy to assess model stability and performance.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes Random Forest Survival models with optimal hyperparameters.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Calculates AUC, Brier Score, IBS, and C-index at multiple time horizons.
- **Visualization**: Generates time-dependent AUC and Brier Score plots with 95% confidence intervals.
- **Calibration Analysis**: Provides calibration plots at specific time points to evaluate model reliability.
- **Result Summarization**: Aggregates and summarizes evaluation metrics across all cross-validation splits.
